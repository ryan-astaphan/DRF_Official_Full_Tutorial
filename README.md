# The Official Django Rest Framework Tutorial
As a new programmer, I prefer learning with video tutorials before moving onto official documentation. Having already completed 5+ hours of video tutorials ([Repos1](https://youtu.be/B38aDwUpcFc)) and ([Repos2](https://github.com/ryan-in-thailand/Django-Rest-Framework-Beginners-Project-JustDjango.com)), as well as the official quickstart guide ([Repos3](https://github.com/ryan-in-thailand/DRF-Official-Quickstart-Tutorial)), I moved onto the official, full-length tutorial. 
For this project I found myself feeling very familiar with the concepts covered and appreciated further cementing this base-level knowledge:
* Models and serializers
* Function-based and class-based views
* Permissions and authentication
* Viewsets and routers
